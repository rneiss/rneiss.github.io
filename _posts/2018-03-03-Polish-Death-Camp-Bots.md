**Description**

On January 26, 2018 Poland's Senate passed a law banning blaming Poland for any crimes committed during the Holocaust on their soil. The next day, Poland's Minstry of Foreign Affairs singled out usage of the expression ["Polish death camps"](https://mfa.gov.pl/en/news/communique_of_the_ministry_of_foreign_affairs_on_amendment_of_the_act_on_the_institute_of_national_remembrance_). The penalty for violating this crime is three years in prison.

In commemoration of this law, I launched two symbiotic twitter bots. The first, [@AdjDeathCampBot](http://www.twitter.com/AdjDeathCampBot), tweets a single random adjective that isn't the word "Polish" followed by the words "Death Camp." The second, [@obozyZagladyBot](http://www.twitter.com/obozyZagladyBot), uses machine translation to render the tweets from @AdjDeathCampBot into the Polish language -- it is a Polish Death Camp Bot.
