**Description**

[A Scaramucci Ago](http://www.twitter.com/AScaramucciAgo) scrapes the top story from a random news website every hour, and then tweets it roughly ten days later. It's inspired by Anthony Scaramucci short tenure at the White House, and his subsequent bad decision to follow me on Twitter -- also the insane speed in which news stories go from the front page to all but forgotten in our 24-hour news cycle.
