**Description**

[@realPressSecBot](http://www.twitter.com/realPressSecBot) harnesses Twitter's API to check for new tweets from President Donald Trump every 5 minutes. If it finds one, it transforms it using some Python code into the "correct" presidential statement format, thus giving his statements the proper honor befitting the highest office of the land. The properly styled presidential statements are then reposted back to the social media platform.
