**Description**

[@Stl_Manifest](http://www.twitter.com/Stl_Manifest) is a memorial project to the 254 passengers of the MS St. Louis who were murdered by the Nazis after their ship was refused entry into the United States in 1939. The bot was launched on Friday, January 27 2017, which corresponded both with International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and the day that President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning all refugees from entering the United States. In its initial incarnation, the bot tweeted one name of each of the 254 victims every five minutes for over twenty-one hours. It continues to run every June 6th, the annniversary of the boat being forced away from America by the United States Coast Guard.
