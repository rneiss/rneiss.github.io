**Description**

On December 23, 2016, the United Nations passed [UN Security Council Resolution 2334](http://www.un.org/webcast/pdfs/SRES2334-2016.pdf), which amongst other things condemned Israeli settlements east of the 1949 armistice line (the Green Line). 

Realizing that many have no idea where this arbitrary line actually is and what land it actually comprises, I wrote a script to download 10,654 satellite images comprising the entire length of the armistice line from the Jordan River southeast of Tirat Zvi, westward to Umm al-Fahm, southward to Modi'in before cutting back eastward Jerusalem and then jutting out southwest again towards Meitar and the Yatir Forest before again ending in the east near Ein Gedi and the Dead Sea.

These images were stitched together using a single command in my computer's terminal window, and put to music.
