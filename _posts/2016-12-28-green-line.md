**Description**

On December 23, 2016, the United Nations passed [UN Security Council Resolution 2334](http://www.un.org/webcast/pdfs/SRES2334-2016.pdf), which amongst other things condemned Israeli settlements east of the 1949 armistice line. 

There were many responses in Jewish community to this event; _Green Line_ was my contribution. The three and a half minute film seeks to explore both the physical boundary itself, and to explore the mental maps we have created of the land it traverses. It's crafted from 10,654 satellite images downloaded via a Python script, and then stiched together with a single command from my computer's terminal window.
